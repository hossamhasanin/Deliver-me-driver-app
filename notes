* The assigning trips algorithm :
    - I had two ideas about it first that i could build a cloud functions
      and in that cloud function i listen to the on Create event of the trips collection
      so that when ever a new trip created i assign the appropriate driver to it based on his location
      , if the driver rejected the trip there will be another cloud function that will assign another driver.

    - The second idea was that i would make it possible for the drivers to see all the trips closest to them on the map
      and the could choose to accept any on of the available trips themselves.

    - In this app I would use the second method , because it is relatively simple
      and of course I am lazy :)

    - One of the key concepts in querying data from firestore based on location
      is something called geohashing , I use it through a library called geofire
